## YouTube Entertainment Industry Analysis and Insights 

### Introduction 

YouTube is a popular video-sharing platform with billions of users worldwide. It allows users to upload, share, view, comment on and like videos. The platform has become a major source of entertainment and information for people around the world. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the trends and patterns in YouTube content and user behaviour. 

In addition to its entertainment value, YouTube is also used as a marketing tool. Many businesses and organizations use the platform to promote their products and services through sponsored content and advertising. YouTube’s vast user base and targeting options make it an attractive platform for advertisers looking to reach specific audiences, demographics and interests. 

YouTube’s rising importance in the world of marketing made it a perfect platform for us to scrape data from and analyse. Data scraping refers to the process of collecting data from websites or other online sources in a systematic and automated manner. Companies may use data scraping to gather information about their competitors, analyse consumer behaviour, or identify trends in their industry. This information can be used to inform marketing strategies and target specific audiences more effectively.  

In this study, we aim to understand the characteristics of YouTube content and users by analysing a large dataset of YouTube videos, views and subscriber count. To do this, we used the YouTube API to collect data from YouTube and performed a thorough analysis of the collected data. We analysed this data using quantitative and qualitative methods. Our findings suggest that YouTube is a significant source of information and entertainment for young adults and that the platform is dominated by a small number of highly popular channels and videos. 

The objective of this project is to scrape data for the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels (HBO, Netflix, Warner Bros, Marvel Entertainment, 20th Century Studios, and Disney), analyse the same to identify trends, patterns, and visualize the data to provide insights and support decision-making. We chose the entertainment industry since it continues to have notable success over the past few decades.  

### Executive Summary 

This report presents the results of a Python project that aimed to scrape data for the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels (HBO, Netflix, Warner Bros, Marvel Entertainment, 20th Century Studios, and Disney), analyse the data to identify trends, patterns, and visualize the data to provide insights and support decision-making. The data for the channels were accessed using the `YouTube Data API` and were analysed and visualized using tools such as Python, pandas, and seaborn. 

The analysis of the YouTube data showed that the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels have a significant presence on the platform, with a combined total of 25.59 billion views, 68.63 million subscribers, and 29,160 videos. 

From the scraped data, we analysed the HBO, Marvel Entertainment, and Warner Bros Pictures channel. HBO has the least subscribers, the highest number of videos posted and the least views. This should be alarming for the marketing team at HBO because the data says that the audience is not responding well to the content posted by them. The content team for their YouTube channel need to rethink a few decisions.

Warner Bros. Pictures has fewer subscribers but has significant total views, hence we found it necessary to analyze their Top 10 videos. Moreover, we did the same for Marvel Entertainment. This made it easy to compare the data between Marvel Entertainment, Warner Bros. Pictures and Netflix. 

Since Netflix had significantly high views and has the most subscribers, I've decided to do an in-depth analysis of it. The analysis of the Netflix channel data showed that the channel had 6.31257 billion views, 25.3 million subscribers, and 6083 videos. The most popular videos on the channel were “Kaam 25: DIVINE|Sacred Games, Squid Game| Official Trailer”, and “Our Planet|From Desserts to Grasslands”, with 0.0629 billion views, 0.0513 billion views, and 0.0305 billion views respectively.

The project demonstrated the value of web analytics for supporting business functions, such as marketing and content strategy. The analysis and visualization of the YouTube data provided insights into the popularity of the entertainment channels and the success of their videos, which can be used to inform business decisions and improve performance.  

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels are popular among YouTube users and that certain videos on the channels are particularly successful in terms of views and engagement. This information can be used by the marketing and content teams at the channels to identify trends and patterns. Moreover, they can use the same analysis to make effective changes in their database.

Overall, the analysis and visualization of YouTube data for the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels provide valuable insights that can be used by the marketing and content teams at the channels to improve the performance of the channels and to support business functions such as marketing and content strategy. 

### Business Goal Analysis 

The business goal is to analyse and visualize YouTube data from top YouTube entertainment channels. Use the data to identify trends and patterns, and visualize the same to provide insights and support decision-making for these channels. This goal was motivated by the need to understand the popularity and success of the entertainment channels on YouTube, and to use that information to inform business decisions and improve performance. 

Currently, the entertainment industry is using a variety of methods to track and analyse their performance on YouTube, such as manual analysis of the data, and using third-party tools and services. However, these methods have limitations and may not provide a comprehensive or accurate view of the channels' performance on YouTube. 

Web analytics is needed for this project because it allows us to identify trends and patterns in the data, and to provide insights and support decision-making for the YouTube entertainment channels. By analysing the data, we can identify the factors that contribute to the success of the channels, such as the types of videos that are popular, the time of the day when the videos are posted, and the engagement of the subscribers.  

#### Web analytics can potentially achieve the following goals for the YouTube entertainment channels: 

1.	Inform marketing and content strategies: The analysis of the YouTube data can be used to inform marketing and content strategies for the channels. For example, the analysis can identify the types of videos that are most popular among the subscribers and can provide insights into the factors that contribute to the success of these videos. This information can be used to develop marketing and content plans that maximize the reach and engagement of the channels' videos. 

2.	Increase the engagement and loyalty of subscribers: Such analysis of YouTube data can be used to identify the factors that contribute to the engagement and loyalty of the channels' subscribers. For example, the analysis can identify the types of videos that are most likely to be shared and commented on by the subscribers and can provide insights into the factors that drive these behaviours. This information can be used to develop strategies that increase the engagement and loyalty of the channels' subscribers. 

3.	Identify opportunities for growth and expansion: The analysis of the YouTube data can be used to identify opportunities for growth and expansion for the channels. For example, the analysis can identify the types of videos that are most popular among the subscribers and can provide insights into the potential for these types of videos in other markets or regions. This information can be used to develop strategies for growth and expansion and to explore new opportunities for the channels. 

Overall, web analytics is a critical tool for achieving the business goal of the business report, and can provide valuable insights and support effective decision-making for the YouTube entertainment channels. 
 
### Dataset Description 

The dataset for this project was obtained from the YouTube Data API. The data included the titles and total number of views for videos on the top 6 YouTube entertainment channels (HBO, Netflix, Warner Bros, Marvel Entertainment, 20th Century Studios, and Disney). The data was accessed using the `‘pandas’` library in Python, and the response was in the JSON format. The data was then converted to a `JSON` object, and the necessary data was extracted and stored in a variable for further analysis. 

#### System Design and Implementation 

1.	Set up the YouTube Data API and obtain an API key: The first step is to set up the `YouTube Data API` and obtain an API key, which is required to access the YouTube data. This can be done by following the instructions provided by Google on the YouTube Data API website. 

2.	Set the parameters for the API request: The next step is to set the parameters for the API request, such as the `YouTube channel IDs` for the top 6 entertainment channels (HBO, Netflix, Warner Bros, Marvel Entertainment, 20th Century Studios, and Disney), the data fields to be included in the response (e.g. video titles and number of views), and the maximum number of results to be returned. 

3.	Send the API request and receive the response: The API request is then sent using the `‘requests’` library in Python, along with the API key and the specified parameters. The response is received in the `JSON` format, and is stored in a variable for further processing. 

4.	Extract the necessary data from the response: The necessary data is then extracted from the response, and is stored in a variable for further analysis. This data may include the titles and number of views for each video on the top 6 entertainment channels, as well as other relevant information. 

5.	Analyze the data to identify trends and patterns: The extracted data is then analysed using Python and other tools and techniques, to identify trends and patterns in the data. For example, the total number of views for each entertainment channel can be calculated, and the most popular videos on each channel can be identified. 

6.	Visualize the data to provide insights and support decision-making: The analysed data is then visualized using Tableau or other visualization tools, to provide insights and support decision-making. For example, the data can be visualized using bar charts, scatter plots, and other visualizations to show the popularity of the entertainment channels and the success of their videos. 

7.	Discuss the results and future directions: Finally, the results of the analysis and visualization are discussed in the project report, and potential improvements and future directions are identified. For example, the results may be used to inform marketing and content strategies for the entertainment channels, and to identify areas for further research and development.

In the future, the project can incorporate additional data sources, such as data from social media platforms, online forums, and other sources. This will provide a more complete picture of the online behaviour and preferences of YouTube users, and will enable more sophisticated analysis and insights. 

3.	Using more advanced analytics and visualization techniques: The current project used basic tools and techniques for analysis and visualization, such as bar charts. In the future, the project can incorporate more advanced analytics and visualization techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the data. This will enable more powerful and accurate analysis, and will provide more actionable insights. 

4.	Integrating the analysis with business operations: The current project only presented the results of the analysis in the project report. In the future, the project can be integrated with the business operations of the YouTube entertainment channels, such as marketing and content strategy. This will enable the results of the analysis to be used more effectively and will provide more tangible benefits to the channels.   

In conclusion, there are many potential directions for improving the project business report, and these directions can be explored in future iterations of the project. By expanding the scope, incorporating additional data sources, using advanced analytics and visualization techniques, and integrating the analysis with business operations, the project can provide more valuable insights and support more effective decision-making for YouTube entertainment channels.
